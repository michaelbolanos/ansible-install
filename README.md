This finely tuned repository provides a simple way to set up OpenSSH and configure public keys on multiple Ubuntu machines to prepare them for Ansible automation.

## 🌟 Features
✅ Installs OpenSSH on target Ubuntu machines.  
✅ Adds your public SSH keys for seamless Ansible access.  
✅ Includes a sample hosts.txt file for Ansible inventory.  

---

## 📥 Step 1: Clone the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
git clone https://github.com/michaelbolanos/ansible-install.git
cd ansible-install


---

## 📄 Step 2: Configure Your Hosts File

Edit the hosts.txt file to include the IP addresses or hostnames of the machines you want to manage with Ansible:

plaintext
192.168.1.100
192.168.1.101
192.168.1.102


---

## 🔧 Step 3: Install OpenSSH via Curl or Wget

Run the following command on each Ubuntu machine to install OpenSSH.

### Using curl
bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelbolanos/ansible-install/main/install_ssh.sh | bash


### Using wget
bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelbolanos/ansible-install/main/install_ssh.sh | bash


---

## 🔑 Step 4: Copy SSH Keys to Remote Machines

To enable passwordless SSH authentication, use the provided ssh-keys.sh script. Run this from your control machine:

bash
bash ssh-keys.sh


📌 This script will:
bash
# Copy SSH public key to each host in hosts.txt
while read -r host; do
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub "ubuntu@$host"
done < hosts.txt

- 📤 Copies your SSH public key to each host listed in hosts.txt
- 🔒 Ensures secure key-based authentication

---

## ✅ Step 5: Verify SSH Access

Once keys are copied, test SSH access to the remote machines:

bash
ssh ubuntu@192.168.1.100


If login works without a password prompt, you're ready to use Ansible! 🎉

---

## ⚙️ Next Steps: Set Up Ansible

Now that SSH is configured, install Ansible and begin automating your infrastructure.

bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ansible


You can now create an Ansible inventory file and start managing your machines!
