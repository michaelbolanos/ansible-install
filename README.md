<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Ansible_logo.svg" alt="Ansible Logo" width="150"/>

This repository provides a simple way to set up OpenSSH and configure public keys on multiple Ubuntu machines to prepare them for Ansible automation.

## 🌟 Features
✅ Installs OpenSSH on target Ubuntu machines. 
✅ Adds your public SSH keys for seamless Ansible access. 
✅ Includes a sample `hosts.txt` file for Ansible inventory.

---

## 📥 Step 1: Clone the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/michaelbolanos/ansible-install.git
cd ansible-install
```

---

## 📄 Step 2: Configure Your Hosts File

Edit the `hosts.txt` file to include the IP addresses or hostnames of the machines you want to manage with Ansible:

```plaintext
192.168.1.100
192.168.1.101
192.168.1.102
```

---

## 🔧 Step 3: Install OpenSSH via Curl or Wget

Run the following command on each Ubuntu machine to install OpenSSH.

### Using `curl`
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelbolanos/ansible-install/main/install_ssh.sh | bash
```

### Using `wget`
```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelbolanos/ansible-install/main/install_ssh.sh | bash
```

---

## 🔑 Step 4: Copy SSH Keys to Remote Machines

To enable passwordless SSH authentication, use the provided `ssh-keys.sh` script. Run this from your control machine:

```bash
bash ssh-keys.sh
```

📌 This script will:
- 📤 Copy your SSH public key to each host listed in `hosts.txt`
- 🔒 Ensure secure key-based authentication

---

## ✅ Step 5: Verify SSH Access

Once keys are copied, test SSH access to the remote machines:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@192.168.1.100
```

If login works without a password prompt, you're ready to use Ansible! 🎉

---

## ⚙️ Next Steps: Set Up Ansible

Now that SSH is configured, install Ansible and begin automating your infrastructure.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ansible
```

You can now create an Ansible inventory file and start managing your machines!
